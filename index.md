 Hi, I'm a postgraduate student currently studying in MSc Data Science program at London School of Economics. I studied Economics and Computer Science as an undergraduate at NYU, where I finished the degree in three years.
 I'm currently seeking summer internship in the internet industry, in particular I'm interested in business analyst, data analyst and product management roles.

 * __A bit about my projects__:
    * <ins>New Yorker's Commute Behavior Analysis During COVID</ins>:
      * _This project included a detailed visual analysis of the commute behavior of New Yorkers via subway, taxi, bicycle during the first few months of COVID pandemic (January-June)_
    * <ins>Group Project: COVID mobility modelling of London</ins>
      * _Social distancing is crucial in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, people in most countries had difficulty in complying to the policies, which led to the frequent surge in number of COVID 19 cases during the past few months. Consider it is impossible to prevent people from travelling, we would like to understand how movement to different types of locations may have varied effect on the level of COVID case increases. This may have the implication in public policies where restrictions only need to be applied to certain kind of locations instead of a complete lockdown._ :
    * <ins>Group Project: U.K. Zero Carbon solution modelling </ins> (__in progress__)
      * _Project that identifies driver of GHG emission and provides potential solution to expedite towards the zero carbon target_
    * <ins>Group Project: Social Network Analysis</ins> (__in progress__)
      * _Model of communities within a company using mails and meetings interactions_
